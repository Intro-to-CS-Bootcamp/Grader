The source code for the grader.

Unfortunately, Google yells at me for sharing the credentials.
So they will have to downloaded from our shared drive, copy the json file
into the directory and it should work.

If any bugs occur, let me know. Will update as soon as possible.


Also, don't forget to download gspread from pip!
